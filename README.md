# Minecraft-Resource-Pack
A mix of resource packs to provide extra utility and creature comforts for my SMP server

A list of vanillatweaks packs can be found inside, armor is also invisible to show off skins. Hopefully someday I can figure out how to toggle between with predicates but I'm still learning datapack stuff :) this readme will change when that happens.

To install, go to settings, options, resource packs, and click Open Resource Pack Folder and put "Server Pack.zip" inside. It does not need to be extracted.

You can use a site like http://www.sha1-online.com/ and paste the download link https://github.com/Cdrsan/Minecraft-Resource-Pack/raw/master/Server%20Pack.zip into the box and click hash to obtain a SHA1 hash. You can then paste this into your server.properties file, in the resource-pack-sha1= field. An example, "resource-pack-sha1=d13a33f2ba466927d96db9e5809f3b6f5fe8e547". This will verify file integrity and auto-update on new commits. 

If it doesn't work (because sometimes it doesn't), make sure players edit your server entry to Server Resource Pack: Prompt instead of Server Resource Pack: Enabled.
