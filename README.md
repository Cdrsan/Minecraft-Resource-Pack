# Minecraft-Resource-Pack
A mix of resource packs to provide extra utility and creature comforts for my SMP server

A list of vanillatweaks packs can be found inside, armor is also invisible to show off skins. Hopefully someday I can figure out how to toggle between with predicates but I'm still learning datapack stuff :) this readme will change when that happens.

To install, go to settings, options, resource packs, and click Open Resource Pack Folder and put "Server Pack.zip" inside. It does not need to be extracted.

If it doesn't work (because sometimes it doesn't), make sure players edit your server entry to Server Resource Pack: Prompt instead of Server Resource Pack: Enabled.
